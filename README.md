## Features

- ðŸŽ² Real-time 3D dice rolling with Three.js
- ðŸŽ® Dynamic character creation with unique paths
- ðŸ“Š Detailed character stats and inventory system
- ðŸ’¼ Corporate-themed missions and challenges
- ðŸŽ¨ AI-generated character portraits
- ðŸŽ¯ Skill-based progression system
- ðŸŽ­ Rich narrative interactions

## How It Works

### LLM Integration
The game uses a Language Learning Model (LLM) to control:

1. Character Generation
   - Creates unique backstories from slot machine words
   - Generates appropriate starting equipment
   - Assigns initial missions based on character path

2. Story Progression
   - Interprets player actions using special tags
   - Controls inventory through [ADD_INV] and [REMOVE_INV] tags
   - Manages stats with [STATS] tags
   - Awards experience with [EXP] tags
   - Updates coins using [COINS] tags
   - Suggests next moves with [MOVES] tags

3. Dynamic Responses
   - Considers character stats for outcomes
   - Uses dice rolls for action resolution
   - Maintains game state and context
   - Provides contextual suggestions

### Cloudflare Workers Setup

The project requires a Cloudflare Worker to handle API requests. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create a Cloudflare Worker:
   ```bash
   npm create cloudflare@latest
   ```

2. Configure Environment Variables:
   - Go to your Worker's settings in Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Add `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` for image generation

3. Deploy the Worker:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

4. Update the fetch URLs in your code to point to your Worker's URL

The Worker handles:
- LLM API requests for game responses
- Image generation for character portraits
- CORS and request forwarding
- API key management

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Three.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Lucide Icons
- Cloudflare Workers
- Replicate API (for image generation)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
